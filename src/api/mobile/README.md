# Mobile API Description

The mobile APIs will communicate with skycoin-exchange, so make sure you have a running skycoin-exchange. 
If you don't have, following the instructions here: [skycoin exchange](https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin-exchange)
to install and run a skycoin exchange server.

## Build

The following cmd will build an ios framework file. For androind just replace the target `ios` with `android`.

``` bash
$ gomobile bind -target=ios github.com/skycoin/skycoin-exchange/src/api/mobile
```

## APIs

### Initialization

```go
func Init(cfg *Config)
```

We use `Config` to init the API env, there're two fields in the struct, wallet dir
and exchange server address. Wallet dir is the place where we used to persist the
wallet file, and the exchange server address is the skycoin-exchange server address,
which looks like: `127.0.0.1:8080`.
